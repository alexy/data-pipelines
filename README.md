# Akka Streams segment
Learn how to use Akka Streams to build stream processing graphs that can consume, produce and transform real time streams of data. This talk will focus on building a throttled stream processing pipeline that reads popular comments from various subsections of Reddit, a popular online community. Along the way, you will learn about concepts including functions as values, higher-order functions, the Scala collections library, backpressure and the reactive streams standard.
